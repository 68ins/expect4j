{"name":"Expect4j","tagline":"A fork of the Expect4J project at http://code.google.com/p/expect4j","body":"### Overview\r\n\r\nA powerful feature of Tcl has always been its integration with the\r\nExpect library (http://expect.nist.gov). As Tcl has been ported to the\r\nJava platform (http://tcljava.sourceforge.net/) certain C-based\r\nlibraries have been left behind. Expect4j is an attempt to rewrite\r\nExpect in Java and provide bindings to the TclJava interpreter. The goal\r\nis to be able to port existing Tcl code bases that use Expect directly\r\nto Java without changes. The current version has successfully run a\r\n10,000 line Tcl script which heavily depends on Expect for it operation.\r\n\r\nExpect is the kitchen sink of IO control. It supports control of\r\nprocesses and sockets, and a complex method of match multiple patterns\r\nat the same time. These are needed in some applications, but it\r\ncomplicates the API a tad. Especially when it used in Java which doesn't\r\nsupport closures natively. There are other libraries which offer a more\r\nconcise API, e.g. enchanter (http://code.google.com/p/enchanter/).\r\nenchanter is a very good library and it is highly recommended for\r\nautomating ssh/telnet sessions. But when Expect syntax is needed,\r\nExpect4j is the way to go.\r\n\r\nExcellent article on using expect4j:\r\nhttp://nikunjp.wordpress.com/2011/07/30/remote-ssh-using-jsch-with-expect4j/\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nPre-requisites:\r\n\r\n  * Maven 3\r\n\r\nBuild instructions:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n# Checkout the repository\r\ngit clone https://github.com/cverges/expect4j.git\r\n\r\n# Change to the workspace\r\ncd expect4j/\r\n\r\n# Build everything via maven\r\nmvn clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Copyright and Licensing\r\n\r\n&copy; 2007 Justin Ryan  \r\n&copy; 2013 Chris Verges &lt;chris.verges@gmail.com&gt;\r\n\r\nLicensed under the terms of the [Apache Public License v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
